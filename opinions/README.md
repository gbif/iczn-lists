# Opinions

This folder contains data and scripts for linking Opinion and Declarations of the ICZN to the corresponding publication in BioStor. The goal is to have complete bibliographic metadata and link to full text for every Opinion and Declaration. 

## Google spreadsheet

Processing of the data uses a Google spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ivfmcac5IC5BhUWCOgOYEKdZQNQSrAzkoNy4GJEGiVc/edit?usp=sharing together with some scripts (the *.gs files). The ImportJSON.gs script comes from https://github.com/fastfedora/google-docs.

This repository contains a tab-delimited view of the spreadsheet.
